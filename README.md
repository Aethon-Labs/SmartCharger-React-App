## Smart Power Bank React Native Application

This is a React Native application for a smart power bank that connects to MQTT and displays information about the charger's status.

The application uses the sp-react-native-mqtt library to connect to an MQTT broker and receive status updates from the power bank. The user can also toggle the power bank's charging mode and turn off the device when not in use.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/username/SmartPowerBank.git


2. Change into the project directory:

4. Start the React Native development server:

5. In a new terminal window, start the React Native application on an iOS or Android simulator:

For iOS:

For Android:

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to monitor the status of a smart power bank that is connected to an MQTT broker. The application will display information about the battery level and charging status of the power bank. 

You can also toggle the power bank's charging mode and turn off the device when it is not in use.
